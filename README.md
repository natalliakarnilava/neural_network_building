# neural_network_building
## project purpose
We need to develop a neural network that will predict the absolute temperature on the surface of a star.

## data description:

Relative luminosity L/Lo - the luminosity of a star relative to the Sun.

Relative radius R/Ro - the radius of the star relative to the radius of the Sun.

The absolute stellar magnitude Mv - an indicator that characterizes the brightness of a star.

Star color (white, red, blue, yellow, yellow-orange, etc.) - colored stars determined on the basis of spectral analysis.

Star type - number corresponding to the star type, where 0 - Brown Dwarf, 1 - Red Dwarf, 2 - White Dwarf, 3 - Main sequence stars, 4 - Supergiant, 5 - Hypergiant

The absolute temperature T(K) - the temperature on the surface of the star in Kelvin.
